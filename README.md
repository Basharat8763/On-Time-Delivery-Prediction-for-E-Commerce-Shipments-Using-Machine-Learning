# On-Time-Delivery-Prediction-for-E-Commerce-Shipments-Using-Machine-Learning
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether a shipment will be delivered on time, using historical logistics data from an e-commerce company.

Project Overview
The goal is to develop a classification model that can accurately determine whether a product shipment will reach the customer on time. Timely deliveries are critical for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in e-commerce logistics.

Problem Statement
Objective:
Predict whether a shipment is delivered on time based on a variety of features, including product details, customer interactions, shipping method, and logistics factors.
